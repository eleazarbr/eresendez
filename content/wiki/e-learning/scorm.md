## Notes
- SCORM, the Shareable Content Object Reference Model
- It’s a standard. Integrates e-learning content into learning management systems (LMSs). Is foundational knowledge for e-learning creation. 
- Why is important? Flexibility, Interoperability, Accessibility, Durability. By creating SCORM-compilant courses, we can be confident our content will work on any LMS.
- Next generation of SCORM in development - Tin Can API or “Experience API” or “xAPI”. It relates better to all learning experiences. 
	- xAPI can track what people are doing on their computers such as: performing work-related tasks, producing work-related outputs, interacting with other on social media, achieving milestones in games and simulations and most other activities.
- ADL vision for the future: 
	- Experience tracking
	- Competency infrastructure
	- Content brokering
	- Learner profiles
